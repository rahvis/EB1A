    Screenshots from KTRK website confirming `Zamana' is its morning program\WithTr%
}

These are screenshots of an archived version of the website.
The website recently moved to `https://utrk.kg' after the TV channel renaming.
The old website name has expired and no longer redirects to the new website.
Still, the old address `ktrk.kg' is used in multiple sources:

\begin{itemize}
    \item BBC media guide for Kyrgyzstan \ExhibitRef{BbcUtrk}.
    \item The program's Facebook group \ExhibitRef{ZamanaVideo}.
\end{itemize}

For this reason, this exhibit shows this archived version on the old address.

This screenshot shows that `Zamana' is the morning program on KTRK:
