\Exhibit{BeamCommits}{%
    A slide showing Beam as one of the repositories with most commits in \Asf from FY2023 report%
}

This is a slide from the annual report for \Asf for the fiscal year 2023.

At the lower-left, the donut chart shows the repositories with the most commits,
and `beam' is seen as one of them at the bottom of the chart.

(As shown in \ExhibitRef{GitCommit}, the number of commits can be a measure of
the developers' activity on a project.)
