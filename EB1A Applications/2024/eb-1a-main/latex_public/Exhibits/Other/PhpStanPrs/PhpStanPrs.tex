\Exhibit{PhpStanPrs}{%
    Pull Requests (code contributions) of \mrl in PHPStan%
}

This is a screenshot of all Pull Requests in the PHPStan code made by \mrl.
(See \ExhibitRef{Prs} on what a Pull Request is and why it means a code contribution.)

Of these Pull Requests, 2 are drafts that were closed without merging,
and the other 2 are merged.
This is proven by the line `\dots by alexeyinkin was merged' in each of the items.
This proves that \mrl has contributed to PHPStan source code.
