This brochure shows the requirements to IEEE Fellow Members
(IEEE Fellow Members are on the review panel that assigns Senior Member grade).
It mentions the following:

\Quote{The IEEE Board of Directors bestows the grade of IEEE Fellow to an IEEE Senior or IEEE Life Senior
Member who has had an outstanding record of contributions in any of the IEEE fields of interest.}

This confirms that IEEE Fellow Members are recognized experts in the field.
This satisfies the last part of this requirement:

\Quote{The petitioner must show that membership in the association requires
outstanding achievements in the field for which classification is sought,
as judged by recognized national or international experts.}
