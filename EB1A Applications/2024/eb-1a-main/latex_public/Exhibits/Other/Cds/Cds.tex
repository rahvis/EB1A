    Torrents of compilation CDs containing hobby computer games by \mrl\WithTr%
}

These screenshots show torrents of compilation CDs
that contain computer games by \mrl: `Lehasoft Dyna' and `Lehasoft TankBattle'.
In the list of games, they are close to the end on the screenshots
for both of these CDs.

One of the disks shows the year 2003 right on its cover.
The other disk shows no verifiable date, but it shows system requirements for the games
that were typical for 2003:

\ParagraphQuote{%
    Windows 95/98/xp , Pentium 166 MMX, 32 Mb RAM, Sound Blaster 16 compatible sound Card, mouse%
}

And the torrent itself was published in January 2010, when \mrl was 24 years old.
For the proof that \mrl was using the alias `Lehasoft', see \ExhibitRef{Lehasoft}.
