    Download statistics for \mrls hobby computer games in 2002--2003\WithTr%

In the early and mid-2000s,
one of the popular software websites in Russia was download.ru.

It has been reorganized since, and the old data was destroyed.
These screenshots on Archive.org show archived versions (2002--2003)
of download statistics of \mrls computer games
(see the proof of authorship just after these statistics screenshots):

These games were published under an alias of `Lehasoft'
(`Leha' is the informal for `Alexey' in Russian),
which \mrl was using back then.
His authorship is proven by the archived version of his own website from 2002:
