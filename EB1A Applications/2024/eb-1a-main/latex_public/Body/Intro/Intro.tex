Dear Immigration Officer,

This following evidence is respectfully submitted in support of the petition of \mrfl
for classification as a qualified immigrant under the first preference employment immigration
for Aliens of Extraordinary Ability pursuant to section 203(b)(1)(A)
of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

This evidence demonstrates that \mrl has extraordinary ability in sciences,
specifically in \underline{\fie}, that he sustained national and international acclaim,
and his achievements have been recognized in the field of expertise.

Specifically, the evidence shows that:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \mrl satisfies \underline{six} of the ten criteria listed in 8
    CFR, Section 204.5(h)(3), namely:

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]

        % 1
        \item Evidence of \mrls receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes
        or awards for excellence \SectionRef{subsec:Awards}.

        % 2
        \item Evidence of \mrls membership in associations in the field which demand
        outstanding achievement of their members \SectionRef{subsec:Associations}.

        \addtocounter{enumii}{1} % 3 -> 4
        % 4
        \item Evidence that \mrl has been asked to judge the work of others on a panel
        \SectionRef{subsec:Judging}.

        % 5
        \item Evidence of \mrls original scientific contributions of major significance
        to the field \SectionRef{subsec:Contributions}.

        \addtocounter{enumii}{2} % 6 -> 8
        % 8
        \item Evidence of \mrls performance of a critical role in distinguished organizations
        \SectionRef{subsec:Role}.

        % 9
        \item Evidence that \mrl commands a high salary in relation to others in the field
        \SectionRef{subsec:Salary}.

    \end{enumerate}

    \item \mrl satisfies \ul{an additional criterion through comparable evidence}.
    Specifically, his technical articles were curated by various teams for wide online distribution,
    which is comparable to scholarly articles for those in academia \SectionRef{subsec:Articles}.

    \item \mrl is one of that small percentage who has risen to the very top
    of the field of \fie, and he has sustained international acclaim \SectionRef{sec:Merits}.

    \item \mrls work will substantially benefit the United States \SectionRef{sec:Benefit}.

\end{enumerate}

Pursuant to 8 CFR, Section 204.5(h)(1),
\mrl may file an I-140 visa petition for classification under
Section 203(b)(1)(A) of the Act as an alien of extraordinary ability in science
on his own behalf.

Pursuant to 8 CFR, Section 204.5(h)(5),
neither an offer for employment in the United States nor a labor certification
is required for this classification.
