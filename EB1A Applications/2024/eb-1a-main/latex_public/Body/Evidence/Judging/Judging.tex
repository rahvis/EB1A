\subsection{%
    Evidence that \mrl has been asked to judge the work of others on a panel%
}
\label{subsec:Judging}


\subsubsection{Proof of judging}

\mrl was asked to review the applications for the IEEE Senior Membership grade.
The email invitation was sent on behalf of \DrZakaria:

\ParagraphQuoteExhibit{%
    <\dots>%
}{IeeeJudgingInvitation}

\mrl registered for the panel \ExhibitRef{IeeeJudgingConfirmation}.

During the panel meeting, \mrl reviewed 11 applications \ExhibitRef{IeeeJudgingApplications}.

After the panel meeting, he received a Thank You letter:

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    <\dots>
}{\DrZakariaT}{IeeeJudgingThankYou}


\subsubsection{Proof of the same or allied specialization}

A candidate for the IEEE Senior Membership

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    \dots shall be an engineer, scientist, educator, technical executive or originator in IEEE-designated fields.%
}{IEEE Senior Member requirements}{IeeeSeniorRequirements}

Those fields of interest are defined as:

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    Engineering

    \ul{Computer sciences and information technology}

    Physical sciences

    Biological and medical sciences

    Mathematics

    Technical communications, education, management, law and policy%
}{IEEE Senior Member requirements}{IeeeSeniorRequirements}

They include \Quote{Computer sciences and information technology}, which is \mrls field.


\subsubsection{Proof of high requirements to be on the panel}

One needs to be at least a Senior Member of IEEE to be considered for the panel:

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    A panel of reviewers is recruited among \ul{Senior members, Life Senior members, and Fellows}%
}{IEEE Website, Senior membership review panel page}{IeeeReviewPanel}

The invitation email confirms that:

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    <A quote that confirms the requirement and that is was met by \mrl>.%
}{Invitation Email}{IeeeJudgingInvitation}

\mrl holds the IEEE Senior Membership grade as shown earlier \ExhibitRef{IeeePresidentLetter}.

\subsubsection{Proof of the high rank of the applicants}

The requirements for applicants are high:

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    Candidates shall have been in professional practice for at least ten years.

    Candidates shall have shown \ul{significant performance over a period of at least five of those years}.%
}{IEEE Senior Member requirements}{IeeeSeniorRequirements}

By the time of the panel review, those requirements are already confirmed
by three references for each of the applicants:

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    In addition, candidates for Senior Member grade must supply three references
    from current IEEE members holding the grade of Fellow, Senior Member, or Honorary Member.%
}{IEEE Senior Member requirements}{IeeeSeniorRequirements}

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    In order for an application to be reviewed at a Review Panel meeting,
    the application, resume, and \ul{required reference forms have to be submitted}
    and received at least Seven days prior to the meeting date.%
}{IEEE Website, Senior membership review panel page}{IeeeReviewPanel}


\subsubsection{Proof of the high rank of the association}

\Ieee is a distinguished professional association because:

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    The IEEE traces its founding to 1884\dots

    As of 2021, IEEE has over 400,000 members in 160 countries\dots

    IEEE claims to produce over 30\% of the world's literature
    in the electrical, electronics, and computer engineering fields,
    publishing approximately 200 peer-reviewed journals and magazines.
    IEEE publishes more than 1,200 conference proceedings every year.%
}{Wikipedia for IEEE}{IeeeWikipedia}

Independently, Samsung names \Ieee

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    the world's largest technical professional organization%
}{A piece of news on Samsung website}{Samsung}

This proves that \mrl has been judging high-rank applicants for a high-rank program
in a distinguished professional association.
