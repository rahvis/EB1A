\subsubsection{\Ieee (IEEE), Senior Membership}
\label{subsubsec:AssociationsIeee}

\SubSubSubSection{Proof of \mrl being a member of IEEE}

\mrl is a member of IEEE, which is proven by his membership card \ExhibitRef{IeeeCard}.


\SubSubSubSection{Proof of the Senior membership grade of \mrl}

The Senior membership grade of \mrl is proved by:

\begin{itemize}

    \item The notification from Zuhaina Zakaria, the 2023 Chair of Admission and Advancement Committee
    of IEEE \ExhibitRef{IeeeElevationNotification}.

    \item The greeting letter from Saifur Rahman, the 2023 president of IEEE \ExhibitRef{IeeePresidentLetter}.

\end{itemize}


\SubSubSubSection{Proof of IEEE being a professional association in \mrls field of \fie}

The Wikipedia page for IEEE mentions the following facts:

\ParagraphQuote{%
    The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is
    a 501(c)(3) professional association for electronics engineering, electrical engineering,
    and other related disciplines with its corporate office in New York City.%
}

\ParagraphQuote{%
    The IEEE traces its founding to 1884.%
}

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    As of 2021, IEEE has over 400,000 members in 160 countries.%
}{Wikipedia for IEEE}{IeeeWikipedia}

This makes IEEE one of the largest and most significant professional associations for engineers.

This is independently confirmed by Samsung in one of their announcements
mentioning that \Ieee is

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    the world's largest technical professional organization%
}{A piece of news on Samsung website}{Samsung}

Furthermore, the designated fields of IEEE include
\QuoteByExhibit{\ul{Computer Sciences and Information Technology}}{IEEE Senior member requirements page}{IeeeSeniorRequirements},
which includes \mrls field of \fie.


\SubSubSubSection{Proof that outstanding achievements are required for IEEE Senior membership}

The IEEE website lists requirements for Senior membership.
Among other things, the following is required:

\ParagraphQuote{%
    Candidates shall have been in professional practice for at least ten years%
}
\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    Candidates shall have shown significant performance over a period of at least five of those years%
}{IEEE Senior member requirements page}{IeeeSeniorRequirements}

`Significant performance' is further defined as the following:

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    \ul{Substantial job responsibilities} such as team leader, task supervisor,
    engineer in charge of a program or project, engineer or scientist
    performing research \ul{with some measure of success (papers)},
    or faculty developing and teaching courses \ul{with research and publications},
    all are indications of significant performance.
    The following are also indications of significant performance:

    \begin{itemize}

        \item \ul{Substantial} engineering responsibility or \ul{achievement}

        \item Publication of engineering or scientific papers, books, or inventions

        \item Technical direction, or management of important scientific or engineering work,
        \ul{with evidence of accomplishment}

        \item \ul{Recognized contributions} to the welfare of the scientific or engineering profession
    \end{itemize}
\dots}{IEEE Senior member requirements page}{IeeeSeniorRequirements}

This shows that neither tenure in profession, nor important position by themselves qualify
for Senior membership, but achievements are required.

Also important is that

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    \ul{Senior member is the highest grade for which IEEE members can apply}.%
}{IEEE Senior membership home page}{IeeeSeniorHighest}

The USCIS policy specifically allows associations
at which the applicant's membership level requires significant contributions
to be used for this criterion:

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    As a possible example, general membership in an international organization
    for engineering and technology professionals may not meet the requirements of the criterion.
    However, if that same organization at the fellow level requires, in part,
    that a nominee have accomplishments that have, for example, \ul{contributed importantly}
    to the advancement or application of engineering, science, and technology,
    and that a council of experts and a committee of current fellows judges the nominations
    for fellows, that higher, fellow level may be qualifying.

    Another possible qualifying example may include membership as a fellow
    in a scientific society dedicated to artificial intelligence if the membership
    is based on recognition of a nominee's \ul{significant,
    sustained contributions} to the field of artificial intelligence,
    and a panel of current fellows makes the selection of new fellows.%
}{\PolicyManual}{AssociationsUscisPolicy}


\SubSubSubSection{%
    Proof that Senior member applicants are judged by recognized
    national or international experts in their disciplines or fields
}

Judging by international experts starts with the references
from other Senior Members one needs to collect to apply.
The references of \mrl are shown in \ExhibitRef{IeeeReferences}.

Among the references was \MrIeeeReferenceOne,
a software developer with particularly distinguished reputation.
He is the creator of <IEEE Reference 1 Project 1>, a component for <\dots>,
which has over <many figures> GitHub stars
(see \ExhibitRef{GitHubStars} on why it is a valid popularity metric)
and is used in more than <many figures> other open-source projects across GitHub \ExhibitRef{IeeeReferenceOneProjectOneGitHub}.
His authorship is confirmed by matching his GitHub username \Quote{<username>} \ExhibitRef{IeeeReferenceOneGitHub}
with the address of the GitHub repository \ExhibitRef{IeeeReferenceOneProjectOneGitHub}.

\MrIeeeReferenceOne is also an author of <IEEE Reference 1 Project 2>, an <\dots>
with over <many figures> GitHub stars \ExhibitRef{IeeeReferenceOneProjectTwoStars}.
His authorship is confirmed by the fact that he is the oldest and largest contributor
to the project code \ExhibitRef{IeeeReferenceOneProjectTwoContributors}.

The LinkedIn page of \MrIeeeReferenceOne is in \ExhibitRef{IeeeReferenceOneLinkedIn}.

As shown on the IEEE website,
IEEE Admission and Advancement Senior Member Review Panel
is the body that elevates members to the Senior grade.

Its composition is the following:

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    A panel of reviewers is recruited among Senior members,
    Life Senior members, and Fellows in the section where the meeting is to be held.%
}{IEEE Website}{IeeeReviewPanel}

%A Fellow member is an even higher grade than Senior member
%as shown in \ExhibitRef{IeeeFellowBrochure}, the grade one cannot even apply for by themselves.

The panel meeting at which \mrl was granted Senior membership
was chaired by Dr. Zuhaina Zakaria personally as she announced on LinkedIn \ExhibitRef{ZakariaMeeting}.

She is the 2023 Chair of Admission and Advancement Committee at IEEE \ExhibitRef{IeeeElevationNotification}.

She is also the Dean at Institute of Postgraduate Studies and
a professor at Universiti Teknologi MARA in Malaysia.

She is an

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{%
    Experienced Professor with a demonstrated history of working in the education management industry.
    Strong education professional skilled in Mathematical Modeling, E-Learning, Matlab,
    Power Systems, and Computer Science.%
}{Dr. Zuhaina Zakaria's LinkedIn page}{ZakariaLinkedIn}

This means that the achievements of the Senior member candidates are judged
by recognized national or international experts in their disciplines or fields.
