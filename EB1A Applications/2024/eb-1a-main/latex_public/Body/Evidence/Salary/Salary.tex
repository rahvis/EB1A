\label{subsec:Salary}

\mrl was working for Akvelon-Georgia LLC on the position of `Software Development Engineer'
\ExhibitRef{AkvelonContract}.

His first day was June 6, 2022, confirmed by his contract \ExhibitRef{AkvelonContract}.
His last day was June 16, 2023, confirmed by the agreement on the termination of the contract \ExhibitRef{AkvelonTermination}.


\subsubsection{The average salary of software developers in Georgia in 2022 Q3 -- 2023 Q2}


\SubSubSubSection{According to Forbes Georgia}

Forbes Georgia indicates that the median salary in the IT field was 4500 Georgian Lari in 2022
\ExhibitRef{ForbesSalary}.
It can be trusted because Forbes Georgia is an official regional publication
of the international Forbes magazine \ExhibitRef{ForbesWikipedia}.

This gives the year salary of

\[
    4500\:GEL \cdot 12 = 54000\:GEL
\]

\SubSubSubSection{According to the National Statistics Office of Georgia}

For that period of time, the National Statistics Office of Georgia
reported the following average monthly salary before taxes for the occupation of
`Computer programming, consultancy and related activities'
(which is as close as they can get to software developers),
confirmed by them in writing in \ExhibitRef{GeoStatResponse}:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|r|}
        \hline
        & 2022 Q3 & 2022 Q4 & 2023 Q1 & 2023 Q2 \\
        \hline
        Monthly salary, GEL & 6870.10 & 6654.40 & 6391.70 & 6826.80 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

This makes the following average year salary for 2022 Q3 through 2023 Q2:

\[
    6870.10 \cdot 3 + 6654.40 \cdot 3 + 6391.70 \cdot 3 + 6826.80 \cdot 3 = 80229\:GEL
\]

For reference, 1 United States dollar was equal to 2.6118 Georgian Lari (GEL) on June 16, 2023
\ExhibitRef{AkvelonBankRate},
the last day of \mrls employment at Akvelon.
So the average year salary of a computer programmer in Georgia was

\[
    \frac{80229\:GEL}{2.6118\:\frac{GEL}{USD}} \approx 30717.90\:USD
\]


\subsubsection{The salary of \mrl in 2022 Q3 -- 2023 Q2}

\mrls contract with Akvelon sets his monthly salary at 3500 USD for the first 3 months
and 4000 USD afterwards \ExhibitRef{AkvelonContract}, payable in Georgian Lari.
This salary was later increased even more.

During his employment at Akvelon, \mrl has received 155887.03 Georgian Lari as salary after taxes on his bank account,
as confirmed by his bank statement \ExhibitRef{BogStatement}.

The salary before taxes was 167014.90 Georgian Lari,
as confirmed by the response from Revenue Service of Georgia \ExhibitRef{AkvelonRsSalary}.

\mrl was employed at Akvelon for 1 year and 11 days, or 1.0306 years,
so that figure translates to a year salary of

\[
    \frac{167014.90\:GEL}{1.0306} \approx 162055.98\:GEL
\]

For reference, that is

\[
    \frac{162055.98\:GEL}{2.6118\:\frac{GEL}{USD}} \approx 62047.62\:USD
\]


\subsubsection{\mrls multiplier over the average salary}

\SubSubSubSection{Over the Forbes figure}

\mrls salary was 3.001 times higher than the median salary in IT in 2022, as

\[
    \frac{162055.98\:GEL}{54000\:GEL} \approx 3.001
\]

\SubSubSubSection{Over the figure of the National Statistics Office of Georgia}

\mrls salary was 2.02 times higher than the average salary for the occupation
of `Computer programming, consultancy and related activities' for those exact quarters of 2022 Q3 -- 2023 Q2, as

\[
    \frac{162055.98\:GEL}{80229\:GEL} \approx 2.02
\]
